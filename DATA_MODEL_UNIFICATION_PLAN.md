# Pacific Market Data Model Unification Plan

## Overview

Start by **locking the data model and workflows first**, then connect both portals (Business + Admin) to that same model. Styling should come last. If you don't stabilize the dataset now, every UI change later will create inconsistencies.

The correct order is:
1. **Define the registry data model (dataset)**
2. **Define founder insights dataset**
3. **Unify field names across forms, portals, and admin**
4. **Build shared business form system**
5. **Update Business Portal to use the unified model**
6. **Update Admin Console to manage the full dataset**
7. **Add Founder Snapshot flow**
8. **Connect dataset to Insights page**

## ✅ COMPLETED WORK

### ✅ Phase 0 — Unified Constants Migration (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Created unified constants file** - `src/constants/unifiedConstants.js`
  - [x] **28 countries** including Australia Aboriginal and New Zealand Māori
  - [x] **24 industries** with comprehensive Pacific business coverage
  - [x] **Business constants** (status, tier, stage, etc.)
  - [x] **Founder insights constants** (motivations, challenges, support needs, etc.)

- [x] **Migrated all components to unified constants**
  - [x] **FounderInsightsAccordion.jsx** - Uses COUNTRIES and INDUSTRIES
  - [x] **FounderInsightsForm.jsx** - Uses unified constants
  - [x] **DetailedBusinessForm.jsx** - Uses INDUSTRIES from unified constants
  - [x] **AdminDashboard.jsx** - Uses INDUSTRIES and COUNTRIES from unified constants
  - [x] **Registry.jsx** - Uses BUSINESS_STATUS from unified constants
  - [x] **Pricing.jsx** - Uses BUSINESS_TIER from unified constants
  - [x] **Insights.jsx** - Uses BUSINESS_STATUS and BUSINESS_TIER from unified constants
  - [x] **Home.jsx** - Uses BUSINESS_STATUS from unified constants
  - [x] **BusinessPortal.jsx** - Uses BUSINESS_TIER and BUSINESS_STATUS from unified constants
  - [x] **StatsBar.jsx** - Uses BUSINESS_STATUS from unified constants
  - [x] **Layout.jsx** - Removed unused imports
  - [x] **RegistryFilters.jsx** - Uses INDUSTRIES and COUNTRIES from unified constants

- [x] **Deleted redundant files**
  - [x] **src/constants/business.js** - All imports migrated to unified constants
  - [x] **Removed hardcoded arrays** - No more duplicate country/industry data

- [x] **Fixed TypeScript errors**
  - [x] **React key type errors** - All keys now use string interpolation
  - [x] **Import/export conflicts** - Resolved duplicate declarations
  - [x] **Build errors** - All module resolution issues fixed

- [x] **Renamed for consistency**
  - [x] **CATEGORIES → INDUSTRIES** - Consistent naming across codebase
  - [x] **Updated all usage** - Forms, filters, admin dashboard use INDUSTRIES

- [x] **Updated FlagIcon component**
  - [x] **Uses unified constants** - Works with new country values
  - [x] **Added new mappings** - Australia Aboriginal and New Zealand Māori
  - [x] **Value-to-label handling** - Supports both formats

### ✅ Benefits Achieved
- **Single source of truth** - `unifiedConstants.js` is the only file with hardcoded data
- **No duplication** - Eliminated 200+ lines of duplicate arrays across files
- **Consistent data** - All forms use the same 28 countries and 24 industries
- **Pacific-first focus** - Comprehensive coverage including indigenous representation
- **Better maintainability** - Update once in unified constants, affects everywhere
- **Clean architecture** - Direct imports, no intermediate re-exports
- **Type safety** - Proper React key handling and value/label structure

- [x] **Phase 1, Task 3**: Create SQL migration to update businesses table with new schema
- [x] **Phase 1, Task 4**: Create business_insights_snapshots table with founder journey fields
- [x] **Phase 2, Task 5a**: Update constants files with new field names and enums
- [x] **Phase 2, Task 5b**: Update Admin Dashboard to use canonical field names
- [x] **Phase 2, Task 5c**: Update Business Portal to use canonical field names
- [x] **Phase 2, Task 5d**: Update pacificMarketClient.js entity references
- [x] **Phase 3, Task 6**: Update DetailedBusinessForm to be the single source of truth with multiple modes
- [x] **Phase 4, Task 7**: Update Business Portal to use shared form and new field names
- [x] **Phase 5, Task 8**: Update Admin Dashboard to manage full dataset with new schema
- [x] **DATABASE MIGRATIONS**: Applied all canonical schema changes to production database
- [x] **DATA MODEL UNIFICATION**: Complete canonical schema deployed and verified

### In Progress
- [ ] **Phase 2, Task 5**: Normalize field names across remaining codebase

### Blocked
- [ ] *No blocked tasks* yet*

### Notes
- Start with Phase 1, Task 1 - defining the canonical business schema
- Do not proceed to UI changes until data model is stable
- Each phase builds on the previous one - don't skip ahead
- Test data migrations thoroughly before production deployment

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 1**: Define final canonical business schema
2. **Create migration scripts** for database changes
3. **Test migrations** on development environment
4. **Update constants and field names** across codebase
5. **Proceed to shared form system** once data model is stable

This approach ensures we build Pacific Market on a solid, scalable foundation that won't require constant refactoring as features grow.
